CNN.com - XML may bring biometrics into the mainstream - March 27, 2002
(idg) -- verifying that you really are who you say you are isn't like it
   used to be. an id badge or password is no longer enough. as more
   biometric devices come to market, however, the industry must grapple
   with how to format data so that it can be efficiently sent to and from
   different devices and shared among many applications. one way to do
   that is to use xml, an authoring language that allows programmers to
   describe data on the web. xml is increasingly popular in b2b
   applications, and now it may be on its way to biometrics.
