CNN.com - 'Hannibal' worst screen bad-guy - August 16, 2001
london, england (cnn) -- just when they said he was beginning to lack
   bite, hannibal lecter has confounded the bad-mouths. the "silence of
   the lambs" villain has been named the "best baddie" in cinema history
   in an internet poll of more than 17,000 film fans. actor anthony
   hopkins' oscar-winning portrayal of the serial killer with a taste for
   human flesh beat "star wars" bad boy darth vader and norman bates of
   alfred hitchcock's classic, "psycho," to claim the title. a spokesman
   for www.only-movies.com, the web site that ran the poll, said it was
   hannibal's wit that made him stand out in the public appetite. "people
   love hannibal's one-liners," he said. (remember at the end of the
   first film when he told fbi agent clarice starling: "i'm just having
   an old friend for dinner?") fourth was alan rickman's sheriff of
   nottingham from "robin hood, prince of thieves," followed by
   ankle-smashing kathy bates from stephen king thriller "misery."
   dracula will probably have a restless night to find himself a
   disappointing 10th in the poll, while ben kingsley as don logan ("sexy
   beast," 2000) improbably beats jaws the shark into 30th place. though
   both these portrayals were trumped by the child catcher from disney's
   "chitty, chitty, bang, bang" which makes an appearance at number 25.
   glenn closes's cruella de vil of "101 dalmatians" comes in 12th. the
   oldest villain to make the top 30 was max shreck's nosferatu in the
   1922 movie of the same name. oscar-winner kevin spacey was the only
   actor to make two appearances on the list, for his roles in the "usual
   suspects" and "se7en." sir anthony hopkins was once asked, what is the
   attraction of these characters? "it's a classic mythological thing,"
   he said as he reprised the lecter role in "hannibal." "in a way it's
   like watching houdini get out of the box. what's he going to do next?"
