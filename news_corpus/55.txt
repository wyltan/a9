CNN.com - Pacific group condemns missile shield - May 16, 2001
sydney, australia -- a south pacific human rights group has called on
   regional nations to oppose a u.s. proposal for a global missile
   defense shield. the fiji-based pacific concerns resource centre (pcrc)
   said plans to develop a missile shield would mean the region would
   involve test firings from the kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands.
   "in the long term, tests could spark a new nuclear arms race and
   restart nuclear testing in the pacific," said the pcrc, an umbrella
   group for various civil groups and non-governmental organizations in
   the region. "it is vital that pacific island leaders unite in
   opposition to the star wars project -- the region should not be used
   as a testing ground for u.s. weapons systems." australia, the largest
   country in the south pacific, has backed president george w. bush's
   national missile defense plan. but few other nations other than direct
   allies of the u.s. have given it their approval. the multi-billion
   dollar national missile defense plan is opposed by china, russia and
   north korea, while several other nations remain neutral on the
   proposal. u.s. officials say it would not be aimed at regional powers,
   such as china and russia, but rather at deterring ballistic missile
   launches by "rogue" states, such as north korea and iraq. the united
   states has already carried out several test firings of anti-missile
   missiles. a u.s. military base in kwajalein is used to fire the "kill
   engine" while targets are launched from california.
