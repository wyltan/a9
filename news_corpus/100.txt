london -- stage and screen colleagues of sir alec guinness have paid
   tribute to the veteran actor after his death at the weekend. "he was
   one of the all time greats of both stage and screen professionally,"
   said ronald neame, who produced six films with guinness, including the
   1946 classic "great expectations." "the wonderful thing about guinness
   was he became the part he was playing, he was like a chameleon, he
   would change colours," he told the bbc. "star wars" creator, george
   lucas, whose films introduced guinness to a new generation of fans,
   said: "he was one of the most talented and respected actors of his
   generation and brought an amazing range and versatility to his work".
   fellow legendary british actor sir john mills said his friend would be
   greatly missed. "alec was very, very unusual," he said. "he was first
   of all, as you know, a very, very great actor, but he was very, very
   retiring, shy, very charming, and he had great humility. he was a
   very, very rare person," mills told britain's gmtv television. "if you
   went to see alec in the theatre in one of his great performances, you
   couldn't get him to talk about it." london's daily telegraph newspaper
   reflected on the words of actor sir peter ustinov in its headline,
   describing guinness as "the outstanding poet of anonymity."
