CNN.com - Entertainment - Indiana beats Bond in heroes poll - January 26, 2001
london, england -- whip-cracking indiana jones has beaten suave secret
   agent james bond to be named the top movie hero of all time. actor
   harrison ford, who has had three outings as the archaeologist, found
   another of his characters, han solo from star wars, made it into the
   top 10 of the survey, by britain's total film magazine. "cinema
   thrives on spectacle and drama, so you need big characters to fill the
   big screen," said the magazine's editor matt mueller. "indiana jones
   won by a massive margin, not just because harrison ford is as handsome
   as they come but because he's a boys' own hero for a generation who
   like their idols to be a smart as well as sexy." in the indiana jones
   movies, ford's character held down a sober academic job while tracking
   down treasures in a series of edge-of-the-seat adventures. another
   star wars character -- darth vader -- had the dubious honour of being
   named the greatest screen villain. rick blaine -- humphrey bogart's
   cool, detached bar owner and mr fixit in casablanca -- is the hero
   from the oldest film in the top 10, dating back nearly 60 years.
   maximus, russell crowe's character from gladiator, is the most recent
   to hit the screen. ripley, sigourney weaver's battling character from
   the four alien movies, is the highest-ranked woman in the poll,
   figuring at number five. top ten heroes: 1. indiana jones. 2. james
   bond. 3. maximus (gladiator). 4. john mcclane (die hard). 5. ellen
   ripley (alien). 6. han solo (star wars). 7. thomas "neo" anderson (the
   matrix). 8. william wallace (braveheart). 9. leon (leon) 10. rick
   blaine (casablanca).
