CNN.com - Placido Domingo plans Ring Cycle for Los Angeles Opera - September 12, 2000
los angeles (reuters) - tenor placido domingo, enjoying his first week
   as artistic director of the los angeles opera, announced plans monday
   for the company's first ever staging of wagner's ring cycle, with
   effects designed by the company that made "star wars" famous. domingo,
   unveiling plans for new productions through 2004, said he hoped to
   turn los angeles into a major stop on the opera lover's itinerary with
   a new staging of the ring cycle with effects designed by industrial
   light and magic. the company was founded by star wars creator george
   lucas and is famed for its mastery of special effects as seen in more
   than 120 films including "jurassic park," "the perfect storm" and
   "stars wars: episode i." a spokeswoman said it was too early to say
   what it will do for the new staging and that it would be up to domingo
   to decide. leonard green, the president of the opera's board, said
   jokingly "i understand though that darth vader will not be playing
   wotan." the cycle will start with "das rheingold" in may 2003 and
   finish with "gotterdammerung" in may 2004. at a press conference at
   the opera, domingo introduced kent nagano, the music director
   designate of berlin's deutsche symphonie, as new principal conductor
   of the los angeles opera and said he would conduct the ring cycle.
   nagano said the composer luciano berio had agreed to "supply us with a
   new opera every year" including one about a great tenor. "he said he
   understood that i worked with one -- placido domingo," nagano said,
   smiling.
