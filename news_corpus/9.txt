CNN.com - Review: Casio tops list of best digital cameras - March 27, 2002
(idg) -- many of the current digital camera offerings seem to be have
   been created using the same cookie cutter. but that's far from true of
   the three new 5-megapixel models we tested for this month's top 10
   digital cameras, $500 and up. the radical of the trio is sony's
   cyber-shot dsc-f707. though this camera falls between the nikon and
   the olympus in size and weight, its design takes a completely
   different direction--it's like something you'd find in the star wars
   prop closet.
